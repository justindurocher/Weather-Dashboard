# Weather Dashboard

<h3><---------- Laptop and Mobile Use ----------></h3>

<h1>Installation</h1>
    
<p>With creating this simple application I first found a weather API that shows the current weather data, as well as a five day forecast data for all major cities in the United States. Then using HTML and CSS I created a simple weatherdashboard to display the data being recieved. Using javaScript, jQuery, and an AJAX call, I was able to fetch the data from the weather API and use it to display the weather in any major city that the user searches in the search bar.</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>The purpose of this application is for users who want to check either what the current weather is of a certain city, or check up on the five day forecast is predicted to be. There is a search bar located in the top left corner where the user can search up as many as 10 cities that will keep popping up as blocks under the search bar. Once the user clicks on one of those blocks, the weather data will be displayed on the dashboard to the right.</p>
